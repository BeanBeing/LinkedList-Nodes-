This directory is supposed to represent using a LinkedList and making the 
the item be pushed to the beginning of the list.

Naturally, you push it to the end of the list, but the function here
will make us push it to the beginning of the list...

1. Create a new item and set its value
2. Link the new item to point to the head of the list
3. Set the head of the list to be our new item
